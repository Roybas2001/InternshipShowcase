            I'm interning at <span class="text-red-gradient">WebElephant</span>, a Marketing and Development firm specializing in E-commerce. 
            In the development department, I collaborate with 6 colleagues. 
            <span class="text-red-gradient">Some of my new colleagues are international so we communicate mostly in English with each other. </span>
            My tasks involve creating tests for our 139 clients, whether it's updating modules or conducting website system migrations. 
            Automation is key, saving time for both WebElephant and clients. Marcel and Mirte mentor me, providing guidance on challenges. 
            Additionally, I can seek assistance from other developers with diverse specializations. 
            <span class="text-red-gradient">During my internship, I aim to learn about CI/CD pipelines, test software, enhance my PHP skills, and work with frameworks like Laravel and Magento 2. </span>
            I'll document my progress, contributing to sprint tickets using the scrum agile method.
